What you know about rolling down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ay
What you know about rolling down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
She say that I'm cool, I'm like yeah, that's true
I believe in G-O-D, don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb
I'ma play her for fun
Y'all don't really know my mental
Lemme give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out, in a drought, no flow, rain wasn't pouring down
See that pain was all around, see my mode was kinda lounge
Didn't know which which-way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it inner motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ay
